# Pocket BioCoder

## 🚀 Project Overview
Pocket BioCoder is a portable device designed to **take a DNA sequence** as input and generate a **Python script** to analyze the DNA. This device uses:
- **ESP32 Microcontroller** for input and display
- **OLED Screen** for a compact, on-the-go interface
- **Raspberry Pi 5** to run a fine-tuned **language model** that generates Python scripts based on the sequence provided

## 🌱 Goals
- **Create a compact device** for real-time DNA sequence analysis.
- **Large language models (LLMs)** to auto-generate bioinformatics scripts based on user input.
- Use **open-source tools** and hardware for accessibility and reproducibility.

## 🛠️ Components
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- **OLED Screen**
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (for running LLM and code generation)
- **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Communication**

## 📄 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone this repo**: `git clone https://github.com/GeorgeVakov/Pocket-BioCoder`
2. **Set up the ESP32** (instructions to follow).
3. **Install dependencies** for the Raspberry Pi (list of dependencies for the LLM).

## 📚 Future Work
- Integrate additional DNA sequence analysis tools (e.g., sequence alignment, structure prediction).
- Enhance the LLM for more accurate and diverse code generation.
